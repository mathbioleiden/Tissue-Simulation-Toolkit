/** Types of particles in the ECM.
 *
 * There are different kinds of particles in the ECM simulation, as follows:
 *
 * - Free particles can move freely, subject to forces applied by bond and
 *   angle constraints applying to them.
 *
 * - Boundary particles are fixed. They anchor the ECM to the walls of the
 *   dish.
 *
 * - Adhesion particles are attached to the cell sitting in or on top of the
 *   ECM. They move with the cell, not with the ECM. Bonds between adhesion and
 *   non-adhesion particles attach the cell to the ECM.
 *
 * - Excluded particles are particles that essentially do not exist. This is
 *   used as a marker to remove particles that e.g. would be inside a cell,
 *   which shouldn't happen.

/** Boundary of the MD representation of the extracellular matrix (ECM).
 *
 * The ECM can be viewed from different perspectives. From a biological
 * perspective, it is (in the simplified representation used here) a collection
 * of collagen strands held together by crosslinkers. The strands consist of
 * strings of a fixed number of beads each, with each bead a coarse-grained MD
 * particle.
 *
 * When seen as a coarse-grained MD simulation, the ECM is a collection of
 * particles, with linear springs constraining the distance between designated
 * pairs of particles and torsion springs constraining angles formed by groups
 * of three particles each. Most of these particles represent the ECM, but some
 * of them represent adhesions and/or other parts of the cells.
 *
 * Finally, from a Cellular Potts perspective, the ECM is a substance covering
 * the domain between the cells which affects the work required to copy pixels.
 * Interaction between a cell and the ECM is via ECM particles that are adhered
 * to by the cell and are dragged along as we attempt to copy the pixel they
 * are in.
 *
 * In this implementation, the ECM and the CPM interact via special particles
 * of type ParticleType::adhesion. These particles and the particles they
 * attach to via bonds and angle constraints form a subset of the MD simulation
 * state that is directly affected by both models. We call this subset the
 * *boundary* between the two models.
 *
 * This class contains the complete state of the boundary: the type and location
 * of the particles in it, and any bonds and angle constraints between them. It
 * does not contain particles that aren't attached to an adhesion particle
 * directly, and it doesn't contain any bonds or angle constraints that do not
 * include an adhesion particle.
 *
 * The representation used here is chosen mostly for flexibility. If a faster
 * representation is needed, then it can usually be generated once after each
 * MD update, and then used for many copy attempts. See AdhesionIndex for an
 * example.
